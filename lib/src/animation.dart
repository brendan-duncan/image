/// image GIF. If you want to generically support both animated and non-animated
/// files, you can always decode to an animation and if the animation has only
/// a single frame, then it's a non-animated image.

/// canvas, such as the case of animations encoding only the changing pixels
/// from one frame to the next. The [width] and [height] and [backgroundColor]
/// properties of the [Animation] provide information about the canvas that
